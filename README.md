# Community detection and POI prediction based on geographical locations

Our work aims to achieve the following tasks:

- Divide users into communities based on their points of interest (POI) and visualize the communities.
    - TF-IDF benchmark
- Visualize the time and space trajectories of users' POI (representative users selected), and make in-depth interpretations from a sociology perspective.
    - overall visiting frequency graph
    - community visiting frequency graph for visualization of community feature
    - individual user visiting route (possible social explanations)
- Design a model to predict/recommend new POIs for users based on their historical POIs.
    - prediction: based on time 
        - visualize the explainability of the model
        - separation based on weekdays and weekends
    - recommendation: based on user embeddings
        - verify: similar type of locations recommended to similar users (examples)
        - benchmark with communities separation results from part 1
